# CIS161-MP1
A program to practice file-handling in C++.

This program was intended to read in a file. Next, the program would print the file's contents out to the screen. Then the program counts the number of letters, lowercase letters, capital letters, numbers, and (as one group) spaces and punctuation marks. Next, the program created a new file, MP1output.dat, that contains the original file, reversed, with all capital letters changed to lowercase, and without spaces, numbers, and punctuation marks. The program gathers the same data from the second file that it collected for the first. Finally, the data is printed to the screen.
